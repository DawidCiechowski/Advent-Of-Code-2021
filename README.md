# Advent of Code 2021 - Dawid Ciechowski

## Advent of Code

[Advent of code](adventofcode.com) is a website, with set of yearly programming challanges for first 25 days of December.

This repository contains my implementation (**sometimes unnecessarily complicated**) of these challenges. All of the challenges are implemented in Python (*Version = 3.8.5*). Most likely will also implement all of these in **GoLang** at later date.

**IMPORTANT**: *Due to busy schedule, these challenges are not finished each day (as they should be, technically), hence there are days, where multiple challenges were done at once.*
