# Advent of Code 2021 - Dawid Ciechowski

## Advent of Code

[Advent of code](adventofcode.com) is a website, with set of yearly programming challanges for first 25 days of December.

This repository contains my implementation (**sometimes unnecessarily complicated**) of these challenges.

**IMPORTANT** - *Due to busy schedule, these challenges are not finished each day, hence there are days, where multiple challenges were done.*
